# oomph

you don’t need a textbook to be a developer, more importantly you don’t learn
code to get a job

You learn code for the same reason you learned to read and write

It is a way for you to communicate, your beliefs

Express your passion and build value not just for yourself but for others

And that is what oomph aims to help you get right, building solutions that not
only improve your life but those of your friends too

What do you want to build

NB: there is a difference between a computer scientist and a developer don’t get
it twisted
